# imdb_api

We are proud to announce you our MVP (coded in the good practice). 

Our service is quite easy to understand and to use. Let me ask you a question...

Have you ever think about watch the rates of a movie before launching it ? 

Not only the imdb rate but other rates proposed on the website to have a concrete point of view. With this service you could see if it's a bad/ average/ good movie. 

We invite you to use our tool, if you write for example on internet a new movie on google. You could have a spoiler inside. With us don't worry you're safe. 

We assure you a great night with your girlfriend or just your friends or your family. 


Technical part :

In the requirement you'll wind every library you need and their version to launch correclty our project, that we hope you'll enjoy. 

How to launch it ? 

1. Create a .env file, to falicitate the evaluation of our project just copy paste this inside. 

api-key = "k_xmalxntj"
base-url = "https://imdb-api.com/en/API/"

Otherwise if you want to you can put your api-key. In the right use each user should put their inside. In the gitignore we add the line for this file to assure the confidentiality. 

2. Streamlit

If you never use streamlit, don't worry that's easy. 

    - In the first time take the PATH of the main.py you cloned. 

    - After, write this line of code. 

            streamlit run "PATH"
    
    - It will open a browser and you'll acess to our project which is initialized in the titanic movie.



Some improvements : The trailer could be added to the service, avoiding the fact to go on youtube and spend so much time on it... 

Thank you sir !!
